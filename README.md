## Introduction
Welcome to the AI Club's first technical workshop focused on PyTorch installations and dependencies. This workshop is designed to lay a strong foundation for your journey in AI, with an emphasis on understanding the basics of PyTorch.

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Installing Anaconda
1. Download Anaconda from [Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
2. Install Anaconda by following the on-screen prompts.

### Installing PIP
- PIP is a package manager for Python, used to install and manage additional packages.
- Install PIP from [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

### Creating Your Python Environment
- conda create -n pytorch3.8 python=3.8

### Activate the environment
 - conda activate pytorch3.8

### To see your environments
 - conda env list

### To deactivate the environment
 - conda deactivate

### Install PyTorch
 - pip install torch

### Install NumPy
 - pip install numpy

# Creating Your First PyTorch Script
 - Open VSCode and create a new folder for your project. Within this folder, create a file named main.py.

 - Copy the code from main.py:

# Run the script
 - python main.py

# Advanced Example: Sentiment Analysis with PyTorch

### Creating the Sentiment Analysis Script
 - Create a new Python file named transformer.py in your project directory.
 - Copy the the code from transformer.py:

### Run the script
 - python transformer.py

# Conclusion
Thank you for participating in our workshop. We hope this README helps you set up and explore PyTorch effectively. Don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions or need further assistance.
